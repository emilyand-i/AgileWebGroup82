-- Virtual Environment Setup --
- Make sure Python3 installed
- Run 'python3 -m venv venv' from project root directory (creates venv folder) NOTE: If you call your environment something else, make sure you dont push the file to the repo. You can add it to the .gitignore folder for simplicity - I learnt this the hard way lol
- Activate the virtual environment with 'source venv/bin/activate' ('venv/Scripts/activate' for windows)
- run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install everything you need for Flask
- run the app with 'python run.py' (add /static/index.html to the end of the URL) 

For users.db
- flask shell
from app import create_app
from app.models import user_db
app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
..  user_db.create_all()
..

To see the table of users:
(the database will go into instance/ folder - we can change this but for ease ill just leave it like that)
- run sqlite3 instance/users.db (inside virtual environemnt )
- .tables and you should see user table
- then you can run any SQL statements to get  the data you want
- .exit to exit sql

## Note:
I will remove all of these steps before submission as I dont think they are necessary
